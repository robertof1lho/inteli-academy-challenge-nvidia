    NVIDIA Inception is a global acceleration platform for AI startups. It supports companies building cutting-edge AI solutions by offering access to technical tools, discounted NVIDIA hardware/software, free training, cloud credits, and exclusive networking with top-tier investors.

    Startups in the program typically focus on areas such as AI infrastructure, robotics, medical imaging, edge computing, autonomous systems, machine learning platforms, and next-gen enterprise software.

    Therefore, an investor is considered "aligned with the NVIDIA Inception thesis" if they:

    - Invest in AI/ML, edge computing, robotics, or vertical AI applications (e.g. healthcare, industry, energy).
    - Have previously invested in early-stage deep-tech startups or accelerators that support them.
    - Mention interest in high-performance computing, computer vision, automation, or simulation technologies.
    - Are part of or collaborate with venture programs that prioritize frontier tech in Latin America.

    Use this definition to guide your investor search and filtering.

    Conduct initial research to discover up to 5 investors aligned with the NVIDIA Inception thesis.

    1. Focus on: VC, CVC, Accelerator, and Angel types.
    2. Prioritize countries: Brazil (BR), Mexico (MX), Argentina (AR), Chile (CL), Colombia (CO).
    3. For each investor found, collect the following fields: name, type, website, country, investment focus, and portfolio URL (if available).
    4. Provide raw information and sources, no need to format strictly.
    5. Do not make up data. Use only reliable sources (official websites, press, directories, Crunchbase, etc.).
    6. Provide links or mention where the information was found when possible.

    Input thesis: "{{ thesis }}"

  expected_output: >
    A short list (3–5) of relevant investors with raw data describing their profiles, focus, and relevance to the NVIDIA Inception thesis.
    The format can be in bullet points, markdown or plain text. This is not the final output — another task will handle the formatting.
